## Getting Started

**React** run in the core of this application but the problem with using React is its used for client side rendering. The best feature of React is that it can be used for both client side and server side and to acheive this I am using [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) framwork.

The working of this application is very simple, The landing page is rendered in the server and the reset of the view is handled in client side, i.e. the browser.

### Prerequisites

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 10.13 and above)

### Setup

To set up this application open your terminal and run the following command.
```
npm install && npm run build

```
The above command will install all the necessary packages and also build the appliation.
